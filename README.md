# Programming Concepts Using Java

This repository contains my personal notes and Java practice code for the **"Programming Concepts using Java"** course offered by **IIT Madras** as part of the **BS Degree in Data Science and Applications**.

## 📚 About

I created this repository to keep track of my learning. It includes:
- 📒 Weekly notes originally written in Notion
- 💻 Java code for practice problems and assignments
- 📆 Organized by weeks for clarity and progression

## 🗂️ Structure

- `Week1.md`, `Week2.md`, etc.: Notes for each week
- `/code`: Java source files corresponding to practice exercises
- `README.md`: Overview of the repository (this file)

## ✅ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Reinforce my understanding of programming concepts using Java
- Serve as a reference for revision and future study
- Share structured content that may help others following the same course

Feel free to explore and use the notes or code if you're taking the same course or learning Java on your own.
